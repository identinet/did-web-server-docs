# did:web Server

The did-web server provides an HTTP server for managing DID Documents for the [did:web method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/). did:web is a simple DID method that relies on DNS and HTTP servers to provide DID Documents that represent a self-sovereign identities. Unlike many other DID methods, did:web doesn't not require a blockchain to operate it. The aim of the web-id Server is to bring the elements of self-sovereign identity management to did:web by allowing the owner of the identity to rotate keys and perform other activities on the DID.
